System-Verilog-FSM
==================

Two simple Moore-type finite state machines initally written in Verilog and then extended with features from SystemVerilog which include always\_comb and always\_ff blocks; assertions; associative arrays for a scoreboard; and the use of packages. Each project contains a simple state machine diagram as well as testing output from the Mentor Questa simulator.
