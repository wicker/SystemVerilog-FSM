Simple finite state machine examples in SystemVerilog

Description
------------

There are two Moore-type finite state machine examples written in Verilog, then extended with features from SystemVerilog which include always\_comb and always\_ff blocks; assertions; associative arrays for a scoreboard; and the use of packages. BothA simple state machine diagram for each is included, as well as testing output from the Mentor Questa simulator.
